# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Diabetes Prediction System** that uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various health parameters. The model is trained on the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical information such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and more.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and data cleaning.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution and correlations.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented various classification models:
  - 📌 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**
  - 🌲 **Decision Tree with Max Depth = 9**
  - 🧠 **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
  - 🏋️ **MLP using Standard Scaler**
- 📈 **Model Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**, which contains the following features:

- 🤰 Pregnancies
- 🍬 Glucose
- ❤️ Blood Pressure
- 🩸 Skin Thickness
- 💉 Insulin
- ⚖️ BMI
- 🧬 Diabetes Pedigree Function
- 🎂 Age
- ✅ Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)
